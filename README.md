# Speed Typing Test
This program is a command line interface (CLI) speed typing test that tracks the user's typing accuracy and speed in words per minute (WPM). The program uses the "curses" library to create an interactive interface. The user is presented with a randomly selected line of text from a file, which they must type as quickly and accurately as possible. The program provides feedback on the user's typing accuracy by displaying incorrect characters in red and correct characters in green.
